## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems on freeCodeCamp (in JavaScript).<br>
The original Project Euler is answer-based problems, while the freeCodeCamp version usually requires a generic solution within a fairly computable range.

The purpose of the codes are to solve the problems on freeCodeCamp within constraints, using the first solution that comes to my mind, which may not be the most efficient one.

All criticisms and suggestions are welcomed!

## Copyright & Licence
While this repository is not licenced, all the codes are written by me. You are free to use my code in any form, however, do note that freeCodeCamp (or similar websites) may have academic honesty policy, which means you cannot use other people's work as your own to complete relevant courses. Please check before proceeding.

Have fun!
